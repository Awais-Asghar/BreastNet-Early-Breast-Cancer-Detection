# BreastNet-Early-Breast-Cancer-Detection
BreastNet is a neural network based model for early detection of breast cancer. The goal is to classify a given breast tissue sample as benign or malignant using numerical features extracted from medical tests. The project builds a full pipeline: data loading, preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and result visualization.
